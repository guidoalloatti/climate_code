# Climate Code Questions

## Coding Question - Climate 
Time given to candidate - 1 hour 
Question: Design data structures to track planting. 
Basic Requirement 
1. Create data structures that represent the following concepts: 
- A grower (a.k.a. farmer) that has a name and owns zero, one, or more farms. 
- A farm has zero, one, or more planting events.. 
- A planting event has a date and a crop type that was planted on that date. 
- A crop type can be corn or soybeans. 
2. Write a function to list the names of every grower that has planted a specific crop type 
this year. 3. Write one or more unit tests to verify the above function works as expected. Try to think 
of valuable cases to test for. 
Bonus questions: 
4. Sort the grower name results of the function so that growers that have planted more 
recently are ordered earlier. 5. How would you optimize the code so that the function will perform better?
